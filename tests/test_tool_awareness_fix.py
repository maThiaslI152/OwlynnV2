Bug condition exploration tests for the router tool awareness fix.

These tests demonstrate the bug exists in the UNFIXED code:
- _looks_like_prose_tool_stall does not accept workspace_files_present parameter
- Long prose responses (>=420 chars) are NOT detected as stalls even when workspace files are present
- Tool guidance lacks explicit read_workspace_file and create_pdf instructions
