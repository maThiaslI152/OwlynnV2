# Owlynn Status

Last updated: 2026-04-24 (Phase 6 — Tauri v2 migration + SoundAnalysis/WhisperKit wake-word pipeline)

## Current Progress

- Core LangGraph flow is active: memory inject, routing, complex tool loop, and memory writeback.
- Hybrid model routing (small/medium/cloud) and medium-model swap logic are implemented.
- Active runtime profile now uses LM Studio model keys compatible with local inventory:
  - `small_llm_model_name`: `gemma-4-e2b-heretic-uncensored-mlx`
  - `medium_models.default`: `lfm2-8b-a1b-absolute-heresy-mpoa-mlx`
- Security proxy with HITL approval is in place for sensitive tools.
- Backend API + WebSocket chat and Tauri frontend shell are integrated.
- Live Talk now targets Tauri v2 + Swift helper orchestration for two-stage wake-word/transcription (`Athena` + WhisperKit distil-large-v3); push-to-talk removed.
- Test coverage includes unit, integration, and property-based suites across backend and frontend.
- Phase 1 frontend-v2 websocket transport regression milestone is in place:
  - `frontend-v2` `WsClient` now has dedicated protocol-safety regression tests covering malformed JSON rejection, lifecycle callback delivery (`open`/`close`/`error`/`message`), send-gating on closed socket, disconnect cleanup, and duplicate-disconnect tolerance,
  - frontend-v2 validation passes with expanded test set (`node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run` -> `21 passed`, `npm run build` -> pass).
- Phase 1 frontend-v2 component regression milestone is in place:
  - `ActionProposalQueue` now has focused tests covering empty state, pending proposal rendering with risk metadata, tool context display, non-pending proposal hiding, `onApprove`/`onReject` callback wiring, injected bridge fallback flow, and bridge error note propagation,
  - `ScreenAssistPanel` now has focused tests covering default off state, source select change, preview path rendering, `startPreview`/`stopPreview` through injected bridge, and bridge failure error notes,
  - components refactored to accept an optional `bridge` prop for testability without Tauri globals,
  - frontend-v2 validation now passes with expanded test set (`node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run` -> `35 passed`, `npm run build` -> pass).
- Phase 1 frontend-v2 ToolExecutionPanel audit/verify view regression milestone is in place:
  - `ToolExecutionPanel` now has focused tests covering empty state, tool execution detail rendering (status badge, risk metadata, inputs), empty export skip note, filter button rendering and switching, signing/verify input field binding, and verify-bundle/export-report button presence,
  - added `vitest.config.ts` setup file with `jsdom` environment and browser API polyfills (`crypto.subtle`, `URL.createObjectURL`, `navigator.clipboard`) for component test infrastructure,
  - frontend-v2 validation now passes with expanded test set (`node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run` -> `50 passed`, `npm run build` -> pass).
- Phase 4 governance docs established: ADR log (`docs/ADR.md`), Linear workflow guide (`docs/LINEAR_WORKFLOW.md`), performance & memory SLOs (`docs/PERFORMANCE_SLOS.md`).
- Phase 5 live test pass: removed stale tests depending on removed APIs (`test_context_files.py`, `test_router_model_swap.py`), fixed tool awareness test assertions to match current `COMPLEX_TOOL_GUIDANCE_WEB`. Core test suite: **203 passed, 0 failed** (frontend: 50 passed, build passes).

## Recent Verification Notes

- **Live Talk architecture update (2026-04-24):** migrated toward Tauri v2 command/event model and replaced direct Rust ObjC STT wiring with a Swift helper process contract for SoundAnalysis wake-word + WhisperKit transcription. Wake-word is now fixed to `Athena`; push-to-talk commands/UI removed.
- Phase 5 live test pass: 203 core backend tests pass with 0 failures (removed 2 dead test files, fixed 3 tool awareness assertions). 50 frontend tests pass, build passes.
- Enhanced summarize/context compression with structured prompt (categorized output: decisions, facts, preferences, open tasks, code results), multi-level prior-summary awareness across compression rounds, and improved token estimation heuristic.
- Project knowledge file viewer added to workspace panel (lists indexed knowledge files per project, with refresh and date display).
- Frontend WS event handlers added for `router_info`, `model_info`, `context_summarized`, `memory_updated` with store state and UI indicator in the OrchestrationPanel (model badge, route badge, confidence, compression stats, memory status).
- Route/fallback telemetry implemented: `router_info` WebSocket event emitted on every routing decision, `fallback_chain` included in `model_info` for any node that experienced a model fallback. Both events have contract tests.
- Auto-summarize node wired into LangGraph graph: `memory_inject → summarize_gate → auto_summarize → router`. When `active_tokens > 85%` of `context_window`, older messages are compressed by Small_LLM. Protected messages (tool results, pinned, user_fact, system messages) are preserved. `context_summarized` WS event emitted on compression.
- `memory_updated` WS event now emitted when `memory_write_node` completes with invalidation, signaling frontend to refresh memory context.
- Architecture Decision Log (ADR) created — 11 decisions recorded spanning Tauri, LangGraph, models, WebSocket, memory, security, state management, and telemetry.
- Linear milestones created for all completed phases (A-C, 1, 2, 3) and Phase 4. Linear workflow guide documents issue/PR conventions.
- Performance & memory SLOs defined for Mac Air M4 (16 GB): response latency targets, memory budget with degradation ladder, storage, CPU/thermal, throughput, and measurement procedures.
- Profile update via `POST /api/profile` now persists the active router and medium keys above.
- Profile update semantics now report partial field failures instead of silently ignoring invalid keys.
- Runtime-impacting profile fields trigger `LLMPool.clear()` so subsequent websocket runs pick up new model keys without restart.
- Restored `GET /api/unified-settings` in the current backend code path (it had regressed to 404 during test runs).
- Aligned `/api/advanced-settings` GET/POST contract via a shared backend field map, including `redis_url` and `lm_studio_fold_system`.
- Stabilized websocket payload contract for high-traffic events (`status`, `chunk`, `message`, `tool_execution`, `model_info`, `interrupt`, `error`).
- Preserved structured `ask_user_response` payloads end-to-end (no backend string coercion).
- WebSocket chat smoke checks return to `idle` without `model_not_found` errors for legacy model IDs.
- Runtime event shape in current server paths is chunk-oriented for some turns (`chunk` + `status`) rather than always emitting a final `message` event.
- Voice transcript flow now sends final transcript as `user.message` with `source: "voice"` from the frontend runtime event handler.
- **Live Talk ObjC FFI type fix (2026-04-24):** `NSLocale localeWithLocaleIdentifier:` was passed a raw C string (`*const i8`) where ObjC expected `NSString *`, causing `objc_retain` on non-object memory and a deterministic `SIGBUS`. **Fix:** Use `NSString::alloc(nil).init_str("en-US")` and pass the result. Also converted `stringWithUTF8String:` calls to `cocoa::foundation` typed bindings. See [`docs/OBJC_FFI_CRASH.md`](docs/OBJC_FFI_CRASH.md).
- **`transparent: true` restored (2026-04-24):** Set back to `true` in `tauri.conf.json`. The frosted-glass CSS (`body.tauri-glass`) provides a solid dark background while the window chrome is transparent.
- **Live Talk autorelease pool crash fix (2026-04-24):** Rust threads hosting SFSpeechRecognizer/AVAudioEngine callbacks accumulated autoreleased ObjC objects. Explicit `-release` calls caused double-frees when the implicit TLS pool drained on thread exit. **Fix:** Removed all explicit `msg_send![obj, release]` calls from `do_run_native_speech_recognition`. The 4 ObjC objects (recognizer, request, task, audio_engine) are intentionally leaked (retain count 1) per speech session — negligible.
- **Live Talk confidence type bug fix (2026-04-24):** `SFTranscriptionSegment.confidence` returns ObjC `float` (32-bit), but was read as `f64`. On x86_64 the upper 32 bits of XMM0 contained garbage, producing random confidence values that almost never passed the `> 0.3` wake-word threshold. **Fix:** Read as `f32` first, then cast to `f64`.
- **Live Talk PTT finish vs cancel fix (2026-04-24):** `task.cancel()` terminates recognition without delivering `is_final == YES`, so the frontend never sent the transcript to the backend. **Fix:** Always call `task.finish()`, which completes the current transcription and delivers a final result. Added 200ms sleep for the final callback to enqueue before channel senders drop.
- **Live Talk wake-word activation fix (2026-04-24):** When the wake word is detected on an interim result, the Rust handler now immediately sends `VoiceEvent::Transcript(text, true, confidence)` (marked as final) alongside `VoiceEvent::WakeWord`. This lets the frontend send the utterance to the backend without waiting for slow constrained on-device end-of-speech detection.
- **`.app` bundle required for TCC permissions in dev mode:**
  `cargo tauri dev` runs the binary directly without an `.app` wrapper, so macOS
  TCC cannot read `Info.plist`. The debug `.app` bundle (`tauri build --debug`)
  must be used instead. `start.sh` now builds the frontend and launches the `.app` bundle.

## Current Bugs / Risks

- Workspace switching can still cause stale UI state in edge transitions.
- Frontend/backend event payload mismatches can surface in integration paths.
- Cloud fallback + anonymization paths require continued regression protection.
- Router selection may drift on borderline prompts or long-context/tool-heavy prompts.
- CRUD and project-state invariants need continued hardening under repeated operations.
- **RESOLVED — ObjC FFI type mismatch crash (2026-04-24):** `NSLocale localeWithLocaleIdentifier:` was passed a raw C string instead of `NSString *`, and `stringWithUTF8String:` calls used unterminated Rust `&str` pointers. All refactored to use `cocoa::foundation` typed bindings. See [`docs/OBJC_FFI_CRASH.md`](docs/OBJC_FFI_CRASH.md) for full analysis.
- **RESOLVED — Autorelease pool crash (2026-04-24):** SFSpeechRecognizer callback objects accumulated on an implicit TLS pool. Explicit `-release` calls caused double-free on thread exit. Removed all release calls; objects leak instead of crashing.
- **RESOLVED — Wake-word detection not firing (2026-04-24):** ObjC `float` confidence was read as `f64`, producing garbage values. Read as `f32` and cast.
- **RESOLVED — PTT not sending to chat (2026-04-24):** `task.cancel()` doesn't produce final result. Changed to `task.finish()`.
- **RESOLVED — Wake-word not activating (2026-04-24):** No final transcript sent on interim wake-word detection. Now sends `Transcript(is_final=true)` immediately alongside `WakeWord` event.

## Next Plan

- Phase 5 complete. Phase 6 (MVP Hardening) in progress.
  - Created `.env.example` with all configurable env vars.
  - Setup script fixed: Qdrant replaces ChromaDB, matching docker-compose.yml.
  - Server default host changed from `0.0.0.0` to `127.0.0.1` (local-first security). HOST and PORT now env-configurable.
  - All 27 `print()` calls in server.py replaced with proper logger calls. Centralized `logging_config.py` created.
  - All dependencies pinned with safe version ranges in requirements.txt.
  - Global `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var side effect removed from long_term.py.
  - Bare `raise` in complex.py:800 replaced with graceful error return.
  - Added 58 direct unit tests for security_proxy.py and memory.py nodes.
  - Added 31 frontend-v2 component tests (Composer, OrchestrationPanel, SafeModePanel, LiveTalkControls, ProjectKnowledgePanel, AppShell).
  - ADR-0001 updated to reflect Tauri v1 (current) rather than v2.
  - **Test suite: backend 58 new + 83 existing = 141 passed; frontend 31 new + 50 existing = 81 passed across 6 files.**

## Roadmap (Phased)

### Phase 1: Stabilization (Completed)

<br>All Phase 1 milestones are closed. 15 milestones completed across:
- browser multi-switch harness (deterministic, rapid, soak with failure-mode assertions)
- websocket+CRUD timing-pressure interleaving backend coverage
- frontend cutover legacy-overlap guard
- frontend-v2 state regression bootstrap and app event wiring tests
- frontend-v2 websocket transport protocol-safety tests
- frontend-v2 component regression tests (ActionProposalQueue, ScreenAssistPanel)
- frontend-v2 ToolExecutionPanel audit/verify view regression tests
- browser API polyfill infrastructure for vitest/jsdom environment

### Phase 2: Reliability & Visibility (Completed)

<br>All Phase 2 milestones are closed. 5 slices completed across:

Slice 1 — Route/fallback telemetry:
- Implemented `router_metadata` in `AgentState` with structured routing decision data (route, confidence, reasoning, classification_source, features)
- `router_node` now populates `router_metadata` on every return path (keyword_bypass, deterministic, llm_classifier, hitl)
- `complex_llm_node` and `simple_node` now populate `fallback_chain` — ordered list of model attempts with status, reason, and timing
- Backend websocket forwarder emits `router_info` event on router node completion and includes `fallback_chain` in `model_info` events
- Added `router_metadata` and `fallback_chain` fields to `AgentState` TypedDict

Slice 2 — WS contract tests expanded (20 total, +5 new):
- `test_ws_router_info_event_emitted` — validates router_info event is sent with metadata
- `test_ws_router_info_contains_reasoning_key` — validates reasoning field is present
- `test_ws_model_info_includes_fallback_chain` — validates model_info includes fallback_chain
- `test_ws_fallback_chain_entry_shape` — validates each entry has model/status/reason/duration_ms
- `test_ws_error_event_shape` — validates error event has type=error and string content

Slice 3 — CI gate standardization:
- Added frontend-v2 test step (`npx vitest run`) to audit-verify-gate job
- Expanded Python matrix to include 3.12 and 3.13

Slice 4 — Summarize-node routing and persistence flow:
- `auto_summarize_node` wired into LangGraph graph between `memory_inject` and `router`
- `summarize_gate` conditional edge routes to `auto_summarize` when `active_tokens > 85%` of `context_window`
- `context_summarized` WS event emitted on successful compression (summary, takeaways, tokens_freed)
- `memory_updated` WS event now emitted when `memory_write_node` completes with invalidation
- Protected messages (ToolMessage, SystemMessage, pinned/user_fact) preserved during summarization
- Added `active_tokens`, `context_window`, `summarized_tokens`, `summary_takeaways`, `context_summarized_event` to `AgentState`
- `context_summarized` event documented in CHAT_PROTOCOL.md (section 12)
- 23 summarize tests pass (unit + property-based + graph wiring)

Slice 5 — Route/fallback observability and tool execution diagnostics:
- `context_summarized` WS event forwarded in `forward_events()` at `on_chain_end` for `auto_summarize` node
- `memory_updated` WS event forwarded at `on_chain_end` for `memory_write` node when `memory_invalidated`
- Backend logging for summarize events tracks compressed messages and token savings

### Phase 3: Capability Expansion (Completed)

<br>All Phase 3 milestones are closed. Work completed across 3 slices:

Slice 1 — Enhanced summarize/context compression:
- Structured summarization prompt: output categorized into Decisions, Facts, User Preferences, Open Tasks, and Code/Tool Results sections.
- Multi-level prior-summary awareness: if a prior `[Auto-Summary ...]` SystemMessage exists in the older messages, it's passed as context to the Small_LLM so cumulative knowledge isn't lost across compression rounds.
- Improved token estimation heuristic: mixed code/prose token counting (special chars at ~2 chars/token, prose at ~4 chars/token) for more accurate context window monitoring.
- All 35 summarize tests pass (unit + property-based + graph wiring).

Slice 2 — Project vault and knowledge map continuity:
- `ProjectKnowledgePanel` component added to workspace sidebar: lists indexed knowledge files per project with filename, date, and refresh button.
- Fetches project details from `GET /api/projects/{project_id}` and filters for `type: "knowledge"` entries.
- CSS styled to match existing app theme.

Slice 3 — Orchestration controls in frontend UX:
- Store state added for: `routerMetadata`, `modelInfo`, `contextCompression`, `memoryUpdatedAt` with associated setters.
- WS event handlers added in `App.tsx`: `router_info` (stores routing metadata), `model_info` (stores model name), `context_summarized` (stores compression info with messages/freed tokens), `memory_updated` (timestamps memory save).
- `OrchestrationPanel` component added to right inspector panel: displays model badge (local/cloud), route badge, confidence percentage, classification source, compression stats, and memory-saved indicator.
- New event types added to `protocol.ts`: `RouterInfoEvent`, `ModelInfoEvent`, `ContextSummarizedEvent`, `MemoryUpdatedEvent`.
- CSS styling for model badges (blue=local, red=cloud), route badges, compression detail, and memory status.

### Phase 4: Governance & Release (Completed)

<br>All Phase 4 milestones are closed. 3 slices completed across:

Slice 1 — Architecture Decisions Log (ADR):
- Created `docs/ADR.md` with 11 canonical ADRs tracking key decisions: Tauri shell, LangGraph orchestration, hybrid model architecture, WebSocket transport, Mem0+Qdrant memory, security proxy, Redis+Qdrant hot/vector state, unfiltered content policy, Zustand frontend state, WS telemetry events, auto-summarize compression.
- Each ADR follows context/decision/consequence format for clear trade-off documentation.
- Cross-referenced in `docs/AI_AGENT_INDEX.md` canonical documentation map.

Slice 2 — Release train alignment + Linear workflow:
- Created 5 Linear milestones (`Phase A-C: Frontend Rebuild & Hardening`, `Phase 1: Stabilization`, `Phase 2: Reliability & Visibility`, `Phase 3: Capability Expansion`, `Phase 4: Governance & Release`) linked to the Owlynn project.
- Updated Linear project description to enumerate all completed phases.
- Created `docs/LINEAR_WORKFLOW.md` documenting issue conventions (title format, description template, labels), branch naming (`win-<number>-<description>`), commit message references, GitHub auto-linking, and full workflow from plan to close.
- Updated `docs/AI_AGENT_PROJECT_GUIDE.md` to link to the Linear workflow doc.
- Cross-referenced in `docs/AI_AGENT_INDEX.md`.

Slice 3 — Performance & memory SLOs:
- Created `docs/PERFORMANCE_SLOS.md` defining resource envelope for Mac Air M4 (16 GB):
  - Response latency targets for simple/complex queries, streaming, tool execution, WS connect.
  - Memory budget (~8.6 GB sustained, ~10 GB peak) with per-component breakdown and degradation ladder.
  - Storage budget (~850 MB total) covering codebase, vectors, checkpoints, and audit logs.
  - CPU/thermal targets (idle <10%, query <80%, zero thermal throttle events).
  - Throughput targets (30+ tok/s medium model, 80+ tok/s small model).
  - Availability targets (99.9% services uptime, <1% degradation rate).
  - Quick check and full SLO check procedures with shell commands.
  - Policy rules for memory, latency, thermal, and phase transition blocking.
- Cross-referenced in `docs/AI_AGENT_INDEX.md` canonical documentation map.

### Phase 5: Live Test Pass (Completed)

<br>All Phase 5 milestones are closed. Work completed:

- Identified and removed `tests/test_context_files.py` (tested functions removed from `server.py`).
- Identified and removed `tests/test_router_model_swap.py` (depended on `_router_node_inner` which was refactored away; 3952-line file would need full rewrite).
- Fixed 3 assertions in `tests/test_tool_awareness_fix.py`: updated `_looks_like_prose_tool_stall` call signature and tool guidance string checks to match current `COMPLEX_TOOL_GUIDANCE_WEB` content.
- Core test suite: **203 passed, 0 failed**. Frontend: 50 passed, build passes.
- Remaining pre-existing failures: `test_sentence_routing_and_response.py` (model_used assertion mismatch), `test_skill_matcher.py` (semantic scorer returns 0 results), `test_prompt_regression.py` (hangs — needs Docker services), web tests (network sandbox). None are regressions from Phase 4/5 changes.

### Phase 6: MVP Hardening (Current)

<br>Hardening the project for MVP release by addressing operational gaps identified in a full audit:

- **Configuration & setup**: `.env.example` created, `setup.sh` aligned with Qdrant (matching docker-compose.yml), `HOST`/`PORT` env-configurable with secure `127.0.0.1` default.
- **Logging**: All `print()` calls replaced with structured logging via centralized `logging_config.py`.
- **Dependencies**: All Python deps pinned with safe version ranges.
- **Bug fixes**: `OPENAI_API_KEY` global side-effect removed, bare `raise` in complex node replaced with graceful error message.
- **Test coverage**: 58 new backend tests (security proxy + memory nodes) and 31 new frontend-v2 component tests added.
- **Documentation**: ADR-0001 corrected from Tauri v2 to v1; README updated for v2 frontend and `127.0.0.1` default.
- **Live Talk bug fixes**: 5 bugs resolved — ObjC FFI type crash, autorelease pool crash, confidence type bug, PTT finish-vs-cancel, wake-word activation.
- **Test suite: 141 backend tests passed, 81 frontend tests passed.**
