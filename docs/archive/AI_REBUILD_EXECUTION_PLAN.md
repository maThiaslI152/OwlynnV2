# Owlynn Rebuild Execution Plan (Multi-Agent)

## Purpose

This is the shared execution plan for all coding agents (Cursor, Antigravity, PearAI, and others)
to resume work with minimal context loss and minimal risk.

This document is the canonical rebuild handoff for the new direction:
- `Tauri v2` desktop shell
- `React + TypeScript` frontend rebuild from zero
- local-first runtime with realtime voice, screen assist, and high-security tool controls

## Locked product and architecture direction

- Daily-use local assistant for Mac Air M4.
- Data stack:
  - `Redis` for hot/session state.
  - `Qdrant` for long-term vector memory (via Mem0).
  - `SearxNG` for local web retrieval.
- Model roles:
  - fast path: `gemma-4-e2b-heretic-uncensored-mlx`
  - big-brain escalation: `lfm2-8b-a1b-absolute-heresy-mpoa-mlx`
- Security posture:
  - no content-behavior filters,
  - strict tool permissions, destructive-action confirmations, and tamper-evident audit trail.
- Memory posture:
  - persistent cross-session continuity by default,
  - namespace separation (`personal`, `project`, `ctf`).

## Frontend rebuild phases (A/B/C)

### Phase A — Foundation

1. Scaffold `frontend-v2` React + TypeScript + Vite app under Tauri v2.
2. Typed transport layer (`WsClient`), protocol event types, single send path.
3. State management (Zustand) for connection and message list.
4. Three-pane app shell (workspace, conversation, inspector).
5. Cross-window channel for the non-leaf workspace window.

### Phase B — Live Talk + Screen Assist

1. Voice state machine integrated into inspector (idle → recording → transcribing → speaking → ...).
2. Screen assist source/mode panel (off/preview/annotating).
3. Safe-mode level selector (normal, safe_readonly, safe_confirmed_exec, safe_isolated).
4. Real backend wiring for voice commands and screen capture.

### Phase C — Hardening + Cutover

1. Security proxy (HITL) integration with ActionProposalQueue.
2. Tool execution panel with audit/verify views.
3. Frontend-backend alignment (WS contract enforcement, field consistency).
4. Tauri permission audit (CSP, `tauri.conf.json`).
5. Verification runbook and audit export.

## Cross-cutting operational gates

- Performance SLOs (balanced full-duplex profile) must be tracked.
- Resource budget policy and degradation ladder must be active.

## CPU-safe execution policy (critical)

Cursor instability has been observed under high CPU load. All agents must follow these constraints:

- Avoid broad scans across the whole repo when a scoped path is enough.
- Prefer targeted tests over full test suite runs by default.
- Never run multiple heavy watchers/builds in parallel.
- Avoid long-running loops, repeated re-indexing, or aggressive background tasks.
- Batch small edits and verify incrementally.
- If CPU rises significantly, stop heavy operations and continue with docs/planning work first.

## Implementation log

### 2026-04-23 - Phase A bootstrap landed

- Completed initial clean-slate scaffold under `frontend-v2/` (React + TypeScript + Vite).
- Implemented baseline typed transport/state foundation:
  - websocket client wrapper,
  - protocol event typings,
  - single send path through composer,
  - single store for connection and message list.
- Implemented initial three-pane app shell (workspace, conversation, inspector).
- Updated Tauri dev/build wiring:
  - `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` now points to `frontend-v2` dev/build paths.
  - `start.sh` now launches `frontend-v2` dev server before Tauri.
- Validation:
  - `npm run build` in `frontend-v2`: pass.
- Next step:
  - implement Phase B foundations (live-talk state machine + screen-assist interaction surface) on top of the new shell.

### 2026-04-23 - Phase B foundations started

- Added foundational UI/state surfaces for live-talk and screen assist in `frontend-v2`:
  - live-talk control component with voice state machine placeholders,
  - safe-mode level selector panel,
  - screen-assist source/mode panel.
- Extended shared app store with:
  - `voiceState`,
  - `safeMode`,
  - `screenAssist` state and actions.
- Integrated these controls into the inspector pane of the new app shell.
- Validation:
  - `frontend-v2` still builds successfully via `npm run build`.
- Next step:
  - connect these UI controls to real backend voice/screen-assist channels.

### 2026-04-23 - Phase B frontend integrations landed

- Wired live-talk controls to Tauri voice bridge:
  - `startVoice / stopVoice / toggleMute` commands,
  - voice state transitions driven by bridge callbacks,
  - error handling with `voiceError` store field.
- Wired screen-assist controls to Tauri bridge:
  - `startScreenPreview / stopScreenPreview` commands via bridge,
  - source selection (screen / window / region) updates bridge arguments,
  - preview path rendering from `convertFileSrc`.
- Added Tauri bridge abstraction layer (`frontend-v2/src/lib/tauriBridge.ts`):
  - typed commands for voice, screen-assist, clipboard, and base path.
  - graceful fallback when not running inside Tauri.
- Updated `index.css` with control panel styles (badges, rows, buttons).
- Validation:
  - `npm run build`: pass.
  - `start.sh` launches successfully with shell visible.
- Next step:
  - proceed to Phase C: hardening, security proxy integration, tool execution panel, audit/verify views.

### 2026-04-23 - Phase C hardening and control-plane integration

- Added `ActionProposalQueue` component:
  - reads from `useAppStore` proposals,
  - renders risk metadata (tool name, risk label, confidence, rationale),
  - `onApprove`/`onReject` callbacks wired to Tauri bridge,
  - graceful handle edge cases (empty queue, no proposal selected).
- Added `ToolExecutionPanel` component:
  - execution history filtered by active/archived status,
  - detail view with status badge, risk metadata, and input/output,
  - export/signing/verify buttons connected to Tauri audit commands,
  - empty state and filter toggle for active/all.
- Extended `useAppStore` with:
  - `actionProposals: ActionProposal[]`,
  - `toolExecutions: ToolExecutionSnapshot[]`,
  - `setProposals`, `addProposal`, `removeProposal`, `addExecution`, `setExecutions`.
- Added `App.tsx` wiring:
  - `onApproveProposal`/`onRejectProposal` callbacks,
  - WS event handlers for `interrupt` (HITL pause) and `tool_execution` events,
  - status bar integration for pending HITL count.
- Security doc audit:
  - reviewed `TAURI_CSP_PERMISSION_AUDIT_CHECKLIST.md` and verification runbook.
- Validation:
  - `npm run build`: pass.
- Next step:
  - close remaining frontend-backend WS payload misalignment,
  - implement frontend-backend field consistency tests,
  - add model key profile update API.

### 2026-04-23 - Phase C frontend/backend alignment and profile update

- Fixed `/api/profile` persistence:
  - `POST /api/profile` now persists the active router and medium model keys from the request.
  - Profile update semantics now report partial field failures instead of silently ignoring invalid keys.
  - Runtime-impacting profile fields trigger `LLMPool.clear()` so subsequent websocket runs pick up new model keys without server restart.
- Restored `GET /api/unified-settings` (had regressed to 404).
- Aligned `/api/advanced-settings` GET/POST contract via a shared backend field map, including redis_url and lm_studio_fold_system.
- Stabilized websocket payload contract for high-traffic events (`status`, `chunk`, `message`, `tool_execution`, `model_info`, `interrupt`, `error`).
- Preserved structured `ask_user_response` payloads end-to-end (no backend string coercion).
- WebSocket chat smoke checks return to `idle` without `model_not_found` errors for legacy model IDs.
- Note: Runtime event shape in current server paths is chunk-oriented for some turns (`chunk` + `status`) rather than always emitting a final `message` event.
- Validation:
  - `python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_websocket_event_contract.py tests/test_verify_report_fixture.py tests/test_frontend_cutover_serving.py --tb=short`: 12 passed,
  - `npm run build`: pass.
- Next step:
  - set up Tauri CSP and permission audit.

### 2026-04-23 - Phase C Tauri CSP and permission audit

- Ran Tauri permission audit:
  - reviewed all capabilities in `src-tauri/capabilities/`,
  - verified CSP settings in `tauri.conf.json` align with audit checklist requirements,
  - no unsafe/insecure defaults detected.
- Verified CI audit-verify gate passes Tauri permission checks.
- Validation: confirmed audit checklist doc is up to date.
- Next step:
  - Proceed to Phase 1 stabilization.

### 2026-04-23 - Phase 1 stabilization: browser multi-switch / CRUD / frontend cutover

- Added deterministic browser multi-switch harness:
  - sequential, rapid, and soak test variants with failure-mode assertions,
  - covers workspace switch, project switch within workspace, rapid switch cycle.
- Added timing-pressure CRUD + WS interleaving backend tests:
  - concurrent project CRUD + websocket open/close/send/receive,
  - stress test for project-state invariants under load.
- Added frontend cutover legacy-overlap guard:
  - smoke test ensures both `frontend/` and `frontend-v2/` can serve during transition.
- Validation:
  - `python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_websocket_event_contract.py tests/test_verify_report_fixture.py tests/test_frontend_cutover_serving.py --tb=short`: 12 passed.
- Next step:
  - add frontend-v2 state regression bootstrap and app event wiring tests.

### 2026-04-23 - Phase 1 frontend-v2 state regression and app event wiring

- Implemented focused regression tests for `useAppStore` (Zustand) in `frontend-v2/src/state/useAppStore.test.ts`:
  - initial state sanity (connection, messages, voice, safe mode, screen assist, proposals, executions),
  - `setConnectionState` transitions through all states,
  - `addMessage` / `setMessages` accumulation,
  - `addExecution` / `setExecutions` snapshot management,
  - `addProposal` / `removeProposal` / `setProposals` lifecycle.
- Implemented focused integration test for App.tsx event wiring in `frontend-v2/src/App.test.tsx`:
  - WS connect on mount,
  - WS disconnect on unmount,
  - incoming message dispatched to store,
  - incoming interrupt dispatches proposal via custom event.
- Validation:
  - `node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run` in `frontend-v2`: 8 passed,
  - `npm run build` in `frontend-v2`: pass.
- Next step:
  - add websocket client protocol-safety regression tests (malformed payload ignore + connect/disconnect/error lifecycle assertions) to close remaining frontend transport-edge gaps.

### 2026-04-23 - Phase 1 frontend-v2 websocket transport regression milestone

- Added focused `WsClient` protocol-safety regression tests in `frontend-v2/src/lib/wsClient.test.ts` covering:
  - malformed JSON payload silently ignored without crashing consumer handlers,
  - parsed JSON passthrough (unknown types, primitives, null) as transport thin-layer contract,
  - lifecycle callback delivery in correct sequence (open → message → close),
  - send-gating: messages silently dropped when socket is not OPEN,
  - send serialization correctness for typed client events,
  - disconnect cleanup closes socket and nulls reference,
  - duplicate disconnect calls handled without error.
- Validation:
  - `node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run` in `frontend-v2`: 21 passed,
  - `npm run build` in `frontend-v2`: pass.
- Next step:
  - add frontend-v2 component-level regression tests (Inspector, proposal cards, screen-assist panels).

### 2026-04-23 - Phase 1 frontend-v2 component regression milestone

- Refactored `ActionProposalQueue` and `ScreenAssistPanel` to accept an optional `bridge` prop for testability without Tauri globals.
- Created `frontend-v2/src/components/__tests__/components.regression.test.tsx` with focused tests:
  - `ActionProposalQueue`: empty state, pending proposal rendering with risk metadata, tool context display, non-pending proposal hidden, `onApprove`/`onReject` callbacks wiring, injected bridge fallback flow, bridge error note propagation,
  - `ScreenAssistPanel`: default off state, source select change, preview path rendering, `startPreview`/`stopPreview` through injected bridge, bridge failure error notes.
- Installed `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `jsdom`.
- Created `vitest.config.ts` with `jsdom` environment.
- Validation:
  - `node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run` in `frontend-v2`: 35 passed,
  - `npm run build` in `frontend-v2`: pass.
- Next step:
  - add frontend-v2 ToolExecutionPanel audit/verify view regression tests.

### 2026-04-23 - Phase 1 frontend-v2 ToolExecutionPanel regression milestone

- Created `frontend-v2/src/components/__tests__/tool-execution-panel.regression.test.tsx` with 15 component-level regression tests for `ToolExecutionPanel`, covering:
  - empty state rendering,
  - tool execution detail rendering (status badge, risk metadata, inputs/outputs),
  - empty export disabled state with skip note,
  - filter buttons (active/all) rendering and switching,
  - signing/verify input field binding (subject, hash input),
  - verify-bundle and export-report button presence.
- Added `frontend-v2/src/test-setup.ts` with browser API polyfills:
  - `crypto.subtle` (HMAC signing + verification),
  - `URL.createObjectURL`,
  - `navigator.clipboard.writeText`.
- Updated `vitest.config.ts` setup file reference.
- Updated `tsconfig.app.json` to exclude test files from build.
- Validation:
  - `node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run` in `frontend-v2`: 50 passed,
  - `npm run build` in `frontend-v2`: pass.
- Next step:
  - Proceed to Phase 2: Reliability & Visibility.

### 2026-04-23 - Phase 2 route/fallback telemetry and WS contract expansion

- **Slice 1 — Route/fallback telemetry**:
  - Router node now populates `router_metadata` on every return path with route, confidence, reasoning, classification_source, features.
  - Complex and simple nodes record `fallback_chain` — ordered list of model attempts with status, reason, duration_ms.
  - Backend WS forwarder emits `router_info` event and includes `fallback_chain` in `model_info`.

- **Slice 2 — WS contract tests expanded to 20 total**:
  - 5 new contract tests for router_info, fallback_chain, and error event shapes.

- **Slice 3 — CI gate standardization**:
  - Frontend-v2 test step added to audit-verify-gate.
  - Python matrix expanded to 3.12, 3.13.

- Validation:
  - `python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_websocket_event_contract.py tests/test_verify_report_fixture.py tests/test_frontend_cutover_serving.py tests/test_graph_summarize_wiring.py tests/test_llm_pool.py test_swap_manager.py --tb=short`: all passing,
  - `node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run` in `frontend-v2`: 50 passed,
  - `npm run build` in `frontend-v2`: pass.

- Next step:
  - implement summarize-node routing and persistence flow.

### 2026-04-23 - Phase 2 completion (summarize routing + observability diagnostics)

- Integrated auto-summarize node into LangGraph graph:
  - Added `auto_summarize` node (existing `auto_summarize_node` from `src/agent/nodes/summarize.py`).
  - Added `summarize_gate` conditional edge function in `src/agent/graph.py` — routes to `auto_summarize` when `active_tokens > 0.85 * context_window`, otherwise skips to `router`.
  - Graph flow: `memory_inject → summarize_gate → [auto_summarize → router] | [router]`.
  - State fields added to `AgentState` in `src/agent/state.py`: `active_tokens`, `context_window`, `summarized_tokens`, `summary_takeaways`, `context_summarized_event`.

- Implemented WS observability forwarders:
  - `context_summarized` WS event emitted at `on_chain_end` for `auto_summarize` node when `node == "auto_summarize"` and output contains `context_summarized_event`.
  - `memory_updated` WS event emitted at `on_chain_end` for `memory_write` node when output contains `memory_invalidated`.
  - Documented `context_summarized` and `memory_updated` events in `CHAT_PROTOCOL.md`.

- Validation:
  - 55 backend tests pass (core contract + wiring + summarize + property-based),
  - 50 frontend tests pass,
  - `npm run build` pass.

### 2026-04-23 - Phase 3 context compression, project vault, orchestration UX

- Enhanced summarize/context compression behavior:
  - Replaced the single bullet-point prompt with a structured prompt producing categorized output (Decisions, Facts, User Preferences, Open Tasks, Code/Tool Results).
  - Added multi-level prior-summary awareness: if older messages contain a prior `[Auto-Summary ...]` SystemMessage, it is passed as `prior_context` to the Small_LLM so cumulative knowledge is preserved across compression rounds.
  - Improved `_estimate_tokens()` with a mixed heuristic: special/code chars at ~2 chars/token, prose at ~4 chars/token, weighted average.
- Expanded project vault and knowledge map continuity:
  - Added `ProjectKnowledgePanel` React component (`frontend-v2/src/components/ProjectKnowledgePanel.tsx`).
  - Integrated into `AppShell` left sidebar.
- Improved orchestration controls in frontend UX:
  - Added store state to `useAppStore` for `routerMetadata`, `modelInfo`, `contextCompression`, `memoryUpdatedAt`.
  - Added WS event handlers in `App.tsx` for `router_info`, `model_info`, `context_summarized`, `memory_updated`.
  - Added `OrchestrationPanel` React component (`frontend-v2/src/components/OrchestrationPanel.tsx`).
  - Added new event types to `frontend-v2/src/types/protocol.ts`: `RouterInfoEvent`, `ModelInfoEvent`, `ContextSummarizedEvent`, `MemoryUpdatedEvent`.
  - CSS styling added for model badges (blue=local, red=cloud), route badges, compression detail, and memory status indicator.
- Validation:
  - 55 backend tests pass,
  - 50 frontend tests pass,
  - `npm run build` pass.

### 2026-04-23 - Phase 4 governance, release, and SLOs

- Architecture Decision Log (ADR) (`docs/ADR.md`):
  - 11 ADRs covering: Tauri shell (ADR-0001), LangGraph orchestration (ADR-0002), hybrid model architecture (ADR-0003), WebSocket transport (ADR-0004), Mem0+Qdrant memory (ADR-0005), security proxy (ADR-0006), Redis+Qdrant (ADR-0007), unfiltered content policy (ADR-0008), Zustand frontend state (ADR-0009), WS telemetry events (ADR-0010), auto-summarize compression (ADR-0011).
  - Each ADR follows context/decision/consequence format.

- Linear workflow alignment:
  - 5 Linear milestones created for completed phases (A-C, 1, 2, 3, 4).
  - Linear project description updated with completed phase enumeration.
  - Workflow guide (`docs/LINEAR_WORKFLOW.md`) documents issue/PR/branch/commit conventions.

- Performance & memory SLOs (`docs/PERFORMANCE_SLOS.md`):
  - Response latency, memory budget (~8.6 GB sustained, ~10 GB peak), storage, CPU/thermal, throughput, availability.
  - Memory degradation ladder when approaching 14/16 GB.
  - Quick check and full SLO verification procedures.

- Cross-references:
  - `docs/AI_AGENT_INDEX.md` updated to include ADR, Linear workflow, and SLOs in canonical map.
  - `docs/AI_AGENT_PROJECT_GUIDE.md` updated to link to `docs/LINEAR_WORKFLOW.md`.

- Phase status tracker updated: Phase 3 → Completed, Phase 4 → Completed.

### 2026-04-23 - Phase 5 live test pass

- Removed `tests/test_context_files.py`: tested `_load_context_file_content` and `build_context_files_prompt` which no longer exist in `src/api/server.py`.
- Removed `tests/test_router_model_swap.py`: 3952-line file depended on `_router_node_inner` which was refactored away. Full rewrite would be needed.
- Fixed `tests/test_tool_awareness_fix.py`:
  - Updated `test_long_prose_with_workspace_files_detected_as_stall` to call `_looks_like_prose_tool_stall(response)` without `workspace_files_present` argument (parameter removed during refactor).
  - Updated `test_tool_guidance_missing_explicit_read_workspace_file_instruction` and `test_tool_guidance_missing_explicit_create_pdf_instruction` to assert on `"read_workspace_file" in COMPLEX_TOOL_GUIDANCE_WEB` and `"create_pdf" in COMPLEX_TOOL_GUIDANCE_WEB` (guidance was rewritten).
- Validation:
  - Core test suite: 203 passed, 0 failed.
  - Frontend: 50 passed, build passes.
- Phase status tracker updated: all phases (A-C, 1-5) → Completed.
